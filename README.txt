# RUNNING THE PROGRAM
###############################################################################
1) This program was written in C++ using NetBeans IDE.  The zip folder contains
	all the necessary code to run the project as well as test cases and a 
	README file. **It is recommended that the user opens and runs the program 
	using the NetBeans IDE as this is what was used to develop the program.**
	To run the program, first extract the files in the zipped folder to a 
	location of your choice.

2) Open the NetBeans project using NetBeans IDE from the extracted folder.

3) Build and clean the program to make sure that everything starts off clean.

4) Run the program.

5) The program will prompt the user for the "Name of file: ". Please provide
	the program with the name of a test file along with the file extension.

	Ex) TestCase2.txt

6) This program will display the results within the NetBeans IDE as well as 
	write the results to a file with _results.txt appened to the name of the 
	input file the user gives to the program. 

**NOTE: If the user decides to not run the project using NetBeans a makefile
	will have to be created linking main.cpp, Event.h, Time.h, and all the 
	necessary libraries.  It is advised to use NetBeans.**
